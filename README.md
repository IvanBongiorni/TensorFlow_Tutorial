# TensorFlow Tutorial






Welcome to my TensorFlow tutorial.
This repository contains several implementations of Deep Learning models based on pure TensorFlow - no Keras here, just plain TensorFlow code.




## Contents:

- **TensorFlow_1_Classification_BatchGD**:      implementation of a Deep Neural Network with simple Gradient Descent optimization.

- **TensorFlow_2_Classification_MiniBatchGD**:  new version of the previous network, with implementation of Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.





## Coming Soon:

- Autoencoder for Dimensionality Reduction / PCA

- How to save and restore TensorFlow models.

- Convolutional Neural Network
