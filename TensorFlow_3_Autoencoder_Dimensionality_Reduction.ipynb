        "\n",
        "There are several kinds of Autoencoders around, such as denoising Autoencoders, and generative models (variational Autoencoders and GANs); they are all meant to accopmlish very specific and different tasks. In this tutotrial, I'll focus on probably the simplest of all: dimensionality reduction. Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction can be conceived as the Neural Network-equivalent of Principal Component Analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this class fo models is neither to learn how to classify observations, nor to predict a continuous output, but to compress, or simplify a dataset. For this reason, Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction are unseupervised models, instead of mainstream Deep Learning models. All the data that pass through an Autoencoder are unlabeled.\n",

        "It is composed of two parts, an **Encoder** and a **Decoder**. The goal of the Encoder is to \"compress\" the dataset, representing its features with a number of nodes/variables that is narrower than the output layer; the goal of the Decoder is to learn how to reproduce, from the central encoded layer, the initial input values. Autoencoder are thus meant to reproduce the input data on the other extreme as accurately as possible.\n",

        "At this point, you have the right to be puzzled. The first time I've read about this architecture, I was like \"Wait a minute, what's the point of all that?!\". And in fact, it's completely pointless. But reproducing the same dataset on the other side of the Network is a trick that allows for a dimensionality reduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fact that the central hidden layers is narrower than the extremes forces the network to find the most efficient way to represent, at that layer, the same data in a more compressed form. The data that flow through that central layer can be seen as a form of dimensionality reduction."

Thanks to the \"simplification\" they perform, it is also possible to train Machine Learnign models on datasets otherwise too big for your run-down old laptop (joking).\n",

        "\n",
        "The advantages of this kind of Neural Network architecture over the more classical PCA is that with an Autoencoder you can potentially capture any non-linear pattern of your data. From PCA instead, you can extract factors that are only linearly associated with your actual variables, making the process of dimensionality reduction much more \"rigid\"."
